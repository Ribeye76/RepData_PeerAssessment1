## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
hist(dfsumact$total, main="Histogram of Days", xlab="number of steps", ylab="days", col="blue")
mean(dfsumact$total)
median(dfsumact$total)


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
